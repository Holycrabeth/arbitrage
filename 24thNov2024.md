# A Long Journey Starts With Small Steps

Lets us today look at a very simple cross AMM exchange arbitrage solidity script.


https://github.com/codeesura/Arbitrage-uniswap-sushiswap


* pls take note that the above code has some error in providing the correct sushiswap address. if i want to deploy my own bot, i will have to triple check the address of the uniswap and sushiswap routers so as to make sure the interaction is valid. 

__A Few Questions And Their Corresponding Answers__


1. what is the mechanism behind the code that will ensure whoever uses the code will get the amount of profit out at the end of the swap?


2. what will be the safety precautions that will ensure no one will front run me or i am the only one that can use this sol code so that no run can detect my transaction and say that Ohh this interaction works well i shall send my own token into the contract to make the profitable trade.
