At first, when the first failure occur, i thought it was because my wallet doesnt have enought WETH in it, but it turns out that my wallet does have some WETH in it, SO, it has to be that the arbitrage was not a profitable one thats why the transaction did not go through.

will try a few more combinations of WETH amount such as 0.05 and 0.1 and 0.2 all the way until 1 WETH, should expect some result but if it doesnt, i will need to do some search online and see what are the most common way of getting a full image of uniswap v2 instances and sushiswap pool instances. 

since the functions that does the swap looks like this:


```solidity
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
        amounts = UniswapV2Library.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path);
        require(amounts[amounts.length - 1] >= amountOutMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT');
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            path[0], msg.sender, UniswapV2Library.pairFor(factory, path[0], path[1]), amounts[0]
        );
        _swap(amounts, path, to);
    }
```

the token path is also important in my case, since both the uniswap v2 pool of GALA/ETH and that of sushiswap is making GALA as the token0 and WETH as the token1, will that be the reason for the failure of arbitrage??


- to eliminate the possibility of the above, i will look for a pair on uniswap and on sushiswap which has different directions.

i have done some research online and i realise most of the pair on uniswap and sushiswap has the same order, but i will try one more time will query on the factory contract and see if they yeild the same result.

how to build a bot that monitors the market data?

how to calculate the optimum amount to arbitrage?

__2.__ what is the best way to detect if there is a price discrepency between different pools of uniswap and sushiswap.
