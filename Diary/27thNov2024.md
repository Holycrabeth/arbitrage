#Carry on from what i have learned about approval functions.


lets find you the function on uniswap v2 router swapForTokens and see what is the two parties involved in the function. 


the following explanation is going to be complicated and long, bear with me


first of all, lets look at the code for swapExactTokensForTokens


```solidity
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
        amounts = UniswapV2Library.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path);
        require(amounts[amounts.length - 1] >= amountOutMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT');
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            path[0], msg.sender, UniswapV2Library.pairFor(factory, path[0], path[1]), amounts[0]
        );
        _swap(amounts, path, to);
    }
```


there is something interesting about the above function, note that it calls for TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom function. 


```solidity
    function safeTransferFrom(
        address token,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        // bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transferFrom(address,address,uint256)')));
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x23b872dd, from, to, value));
        require(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            'TransferHelper::transferFrom: transferFrom failed'
        );
    }
```


this function's 2nd input parameter is address from, which correlates to the original swapExactTokensforTokens function's input of 


```solidity
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            path[0], msg.sender, UniswapV2Library.pairFor(factory, path[0], path[1]), amounts[0]
        );
```

So in this case, who is the msg.sender? apparently, i am an externally own account, i interact with my deployed arbitrage contract which contains a swap function, and the swap function has an embeded swapExactTokensForTokens that points to the uniswap v2 router address. so the msg.sender should be my deployed arbitrage contract since he is the one calling the swapExactTokensForTokens function which has an embeded TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom function.
