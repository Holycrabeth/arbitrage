## Carry On From What We have Achieved So Far

https://github.com/codeesura/Arbitrage-uniswap-sushiswap

talking about receiving native token ETH, i suddenly thought about adding some fallback and receive function to it. 

```solidity
    // Empty receive function
    receive() external payable {}

    // Empty fallback function
    fallback() external payable {}
```

__Questions__


__1.__ deployment on mainnet using hardhat sucessful?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__2.__ what is the best way to find out how much amount is best for arbitrage


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


__3.__ what is the best way to detect if there is a price discrepency between different pools of uniswap and sushiswap.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


__4.__ what about taking out the approval function from the original swap function and create another function that does the approval of whetever necessary tokens. this is to optimize the arbitrage efficiency so that we do not need to approve the amount everytime we arbitrage. 


create a dedicated function that handles approvals for a given token and amount. This allows you to set a large enough allowance initially and only require updating it when necessary 

first we addin the interface for IERC20:


```solidity
interface IERC20 {
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

then we add in another two functions to approve the tokens for the routers to spend inside the contract part of the code:


```solidity
// New function to approve tokens
    function approveToken(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount), "Approval failed");
    }

    // Updated swap function without the approval step
    function swap(address _address, uint256 _amountIn) external onlyOwner {
        // Assuming approval is already handled, the rest of the swap logic goes here
    }
```

__5__ what about the withdrawal of ETH, i know ERC20 can be taken out but what about native tokens such as ETH.


you can do so by introducing a similar function as the erc20 one so to withdraw whatever amount of ETH


```solidity
// Withdraw ETH from the contract
    function withdrawETH(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance in contract");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

    // Withdraw all ETH stored in the contract
    function withdrawAllETH() public onlyOwner {
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
```
