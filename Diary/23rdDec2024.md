Let's start with the installation of MySQL on your Ubuntu server. Here are the steps to install MySQL and secure it:

Step 1: Update Your Server
Before installing any new software, it's a good idea to update your package list to ensure you are installing the latest versions available.


```bash
sudo apt update
```


Step 2: Install MySQL
Now, install the MySQL server package using the following command:


```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```


Step 3: Secure MySQL Installation
After installing MySQL, it's important to run the security script that comes with MySQL. This script will help you secure your MySQL installation, including setting up a root password, removing anonymous users, disallowing root login remotely, and removing the test database.


```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```


During this process, you will be prompted to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN, which can help enforce strong passwords:

Press Y and choose the level of password validation policy (low, medium, or strong).
Set up a root password: Choose a strong password as advised by the security level you selected.
Answer Y for the rest of the prompts: Remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, remove test database, and reload privilege tables.
Step 4: Test MySQL Installation
After securing your installation, test if the MySQL server is working correctly.


```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql.service
```


You should see output indicating that the service is active. You can also try logging into the MySQL console:


```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```


Enter the password you set up during the secure installation process.
