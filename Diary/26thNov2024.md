__1.__ deployment on mainnet using hardhat sucessful?


now the contract is sucessfully deployed on the mainnet with the address of 0xd41b2809885cB3fEF509bb9Fbf0cf190f00167BF

__2.__ testing of the contract with some random pair that exist on both uniswap and sushiswap

The first round of testing was unsucessful. execution reverted due to unable to estimate gas amount, reason being is that
__firstly__ large part of this failure should be due to the lack of approval, 
i did not approve the contract to spend the WETH on my behalf, however, i am not very confident if this is necessary.
__secondly__ i didnt approve the uniswap router function to spend the WETH on my behalf, or should i say on behalf of my contract? i am not sure about thi part either, will have to discuss this with chatgpt and do some independant research on the internet to find out. 
__thirdly__ after getting the desired tokens back from trading in uniswap, will i still have to approve the token for sushiswap to spend it? if yes, meaning to say i will have to approve sushiswap my deployed contract address's ERC20 token on hand right? the token is not with the msg.sender but with the deployed contract. 
 


and this is something that i learn which i think is very crucial in understanding how the approval function works.

The token owner (or holder) calls the approve function on the token contract, specifying the spender's address and the amount of tokens they are allowed to transfer.

The token contract records this approval as an allowance, which is stored in a mapping that links the owner's address with the spender's address and defines the number of tokens they are allowed to handle.

Once an allowance is set, the approved spender can use the transferFrom function to move a specified amount of tokens from the ownerâ€™s account to any other address, but only up to the limit set by the allowance.


with this in mind, lets give a clear login of the swap function and see what happens during the process and checks what are the necessary approvals.

__3.__ what is the best way to find out how much amount is best for arbitrage

__4.__ what is the best way to detect if there is a price discrepency between different pools of uniswap and sushiswap.
