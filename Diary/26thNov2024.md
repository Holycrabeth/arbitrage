__1.__ deployment on mainnet using hardhat sucessful?


now the contract is sucessfully deployed on the mainnet with the address of 0xd41b2809885cB3fEF509bb9Fbf0cf190f00167BF


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


__2.__ testing of the contract with some random pair that exist on both uniswap and sushiswap

The first round of testing was unsucessful. execution reverted due to unable to estimate gas amount, reason being is that
__firstly__ large part of this failure should be due to the lack of approval, 
i did not approve the contract to spend the WETH on my behalf, however, i am not very confident if this is necessary.
__secondly__ i didnt approve the uniswap router function to spend the WETH on my behalf, or should i say on behalf of my contract? i am not sure about thi part either, will have to discuss this with chatgpt and do some independant research on the internet to find out. 
__thirdly__ after getting the desired tokens back from trading in uniswap, will i still have to approve the token for sushiswap to spend it? if yes, meaning to say i will have to approve sushiswap my deployed contract address's ERC20 token on hand right? the token is not with the msg.sender but with the deployed contract.
