#  Carry on from what i have concluded for arbitrage oppotunity discovery


The core logic of what constitutes a profitable is the following


1. define trade direction: selling on uniswap and buying on sushiswap


lets say i have 1 eth to be sold, so what is the effective amount of usd i will get?


this will depend on the getAmountOut function from the uniswap V2 router function


```solidity
    function getAmountOut(uint amountIn, uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut)
        public
        pure
        virtual
        override
        returns (uint amountOut)
    {
        return UniswapV2Library.getAmountOut(amountIn, reserveIn, reserveOut);
    }
```


as you can see, the function calls for another function from uniswapV2Library


```solidity
    function getAmountOut(uint amountIn, uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) internal pure returns (uint amountOut) {
        require(amountIn > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT');
        require(reserveIn > 0 && reserveOut > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
        uint amountInWithFee = amountIn.mul(997);
        uint numerator = amountInWithFee.mul(reserveOut);
        uint denominator = reserveIn.mul(1000).add(amountInWithFee);
        amountOut = numerator / denominator;
    }
```

this function defines the calculation steps involved in swapping without actually swapping, it also takes into consideration of the fee.


from looking at the input parameters, it is simply a very mathematically calculation where we have to specify the amount that we are going to swap, and then the initial reserve of the token that we are swapping and then the initial reserve of the token that we are swapping for.


so to put it in an example lets say the ETH/USDT pair, when we want to swap ETH for USDT, we will need to specify the amount of ETH that we want to swap, and then give it the reserve of ETH at the pool at the moment, and then the reserve of USDT at the pool at the moment as well. it wil help to calculate using the formulaes given in the getAmountOut function.
