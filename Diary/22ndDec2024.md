### to understand what is the best route of arbitrage take a look at this article.

finding the best route involves


first, identify the pairs that completes a loop, meaning to say they end up in the same token like for example, i started with weth and i will end with weth.


then multiply them with the ratio. this ratio is the exchange rate of a token with another. this number can be made recipocal to complete a logical loop.


#### all these boils down to the Bellman-Ford Algorithm. here is a video explaining the algorithm
