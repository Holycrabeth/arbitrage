       (https://github.com/6eer/uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage-bot)

       (https://github.com/codeesura/Arbitrage-uniswap-sushiswap) take note that this code has a sushiswapV2Router Address Point towards arbitrum sushiswap v2 Router, the correct mainnet one should be 0xd9e1cE17f2641f24aE83637ab66a2cca9C378B9F
